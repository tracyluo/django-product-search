# Django Product Search

A Django web application for searching products by description, category, and tags. Includes sample data and a modern, professional UI.

## Features
- Product search by description, category, and tags (combine search and filter options.)

ðŸ“Œ Example Scenario
Input Filters:

Category: "PC Laptops"

Tag: "Back to school sale"

Description contains: "HP"

Search Result:

Only products that are:

In the category "PC Laptops"

Tagged with "Back to school sale"

With a description containing the keyword "HP"

- Category hierarchy (parent/child)
Categories are organized hierarchically, allowing more flexible and precise searches.

Example Hierarchy:
Laptops (Parent)
â”œâ”€â”€ PC Laptops (Child)
â””â”€â”€ MacBooks (Child)

Search Behavior:
Selecting a Parent Category (e.g., Laptops):

Returns all products in the parent category and its child categories.

âœ… Products: PC Laptops + MacBooks

Selecting a Child Category (e.g., PC Laptops):

Returns only products directly under that child category.

âœ… Products: Only PC Laptops

Selecting a Child Category (e.g., MacBooks):

âœ… Products: Only MacBooks

- Tag filtering

- Sample data population via management command

- Responsive, styled product list page
